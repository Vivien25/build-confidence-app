# BetterMe: Build-Confidence-App 🚀
> **Your Empathetic AI Companion for Personal Growth and Confidence.**

BetterMe is an AI-driven platform designed to help users navigate career transitions, overcome social anxiety, and build lasting self-confidence. Unlike traditional productivity tools, BetterMe focuses on the emotional journey, acting as a "Digital Confidant" rather than just a task tracker.

- **Micro-Goal Decomposition:** Automatically breaks down overwhelming objectives into "atomic" daily tasks to prevent burnout.
- **Sentiment-Driven Feedback:** Real-time analysis of user input to adjust coaching style—switching between "Coach Mode" (discipline) and "Friend Mode" (encouragement).
- **Multimodal Interaction:** Supports both text and voice-based interactions for a more natural user experience.

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js / Vite (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI / Flask)
- **AI/ML:** Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro), Speech-to-Text (STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS)
